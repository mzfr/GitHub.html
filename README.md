# GitHub.html

Generate an html file from all the issues, pull requests and list all the repository a user have created.

Created this for [my brother](http://github.com/dufferzafar/), who wanted to see exactly what he has done on GitHub till now.

You can see his output here: https://mzfr.github.io/GitHub.html/

## Running the script

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

$ python3 github.py
Enter a username: dufferzafar
```

File `dufferzafar.html` will be created in the same directory.
